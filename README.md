# gleam
Google Chrome extension that lists the fastest responding linked domains on a page.  It is useful for determining the fastest mirror when presented with a large list of possibilities.

This was inspired by the code at [fastestmirror.appspot.com](http://fastestmirror.appspot.com/).

Icons are by [Dooffy](http://www.dooffy.com/) and found on [IconArchive](http://www.iconarchive.com/show/cosmetic-icons-by-dooffy/12-mirror-icon.html).
